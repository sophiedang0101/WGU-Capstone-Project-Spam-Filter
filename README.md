A spam filter using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate emails. The model achieved approximately 98% accuracy, 100% precision, 84% recall, and 92% F1 score, signifying a high precision in classifying illegitimate and legitimate messages. Additionally, advanced visualization tools such as "wordcloud", "matplotlib", and "seaborn" were used to provide insights into the model's performance and guide necessary adjustments.

The project received the Capstone Excellence Award from Western Governors University.
