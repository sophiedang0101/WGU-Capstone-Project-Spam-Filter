- A spam filter using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate emails.
- The model achieved approximately 98% accuracy, 100% precision, 84% recall, and 92% F1 score, signifying a high precision in classifying illegitimate and legitimate messages.
- Advanced visualization tools such as "wordcloud", "matplotlib", and "seaborn" were used to provide insights into the model's performance and guide necessary adjustments.
- Project received the Capstone Excellence Award from Western Governors University.
